# Redux wannabe library
React state management with immutable states, efficient updates and async iterator actions.

Currently doesn't support middleware. The way I use it is that I just handle all network calls and similar in front of the reducer, i.e. directly from the action. But adding that probably wouldn't be hard.

## How to use
```javascript
```

## But why?
I can't really remember, but I believe the first time I looked at redux it seemed cool and small, but I also wanted it to have Immutable.js state. And apparently doing something similar was pretty easy in just a couple of lines.
